My name is Will Pierce.
I work as a technical writer and researcher, especially in the area information security.

I've contributed documentation and code to open source projects including
the [Rust compiler](https://github.com/rust-lang/rust),
[SecureDrop](https://securedrop.org),
[Qubes OS](https://qubes-os.org),
[OpenOversight](https://OpenOversight.com), and
[Flux](https://github.com/influxdata/flux).

Before working in technology,
I did doctoral research in English literature at Northwestern University,
working on a dissertation about surveillance and theology in Elizabethan England.
